This is a small "OS"-like thing with a loader, which loads the initial prompt and switches to CPU to protected mode, allowing to work with memory and have access to BIOS. The loader is written in Assembly language, since it is the only (relativetely) easy way to do so. The loader then passes the control to loader_helper, which loads the "kernel". The "kernel" is not actually a kernel, but just some ordinary program working on user level and having some privileges in terms of hardware access and memory management. The "kernel" is written in C, but none of the standard libraries are connected, since there are no system calls implemented yet. The OS has an user prompt (console), working directly with the video subsytem.
